Hello world
This is a sample input text
For the WordCount program
Each line contains words
Some lines have repeated words
And some lines have unique words
WordCount counts the occurrences of each word
It produces a word count for each unique word
This helps in analyzing the frequency of words
In a given text
Hello again
This is another line
And here is yet another line
With some more words
Words and words
WordCount program is simple
But it is a useful tool
To understand the text data
And extract insights from it
WordCount is a common task
In data analysis and text processing
It helps in summarizing text data
And identifying important keywords
This is the end of the sample text
Goodbye
